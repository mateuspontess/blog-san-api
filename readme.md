## How to use

### Run

- Clone this repository
- Run the command `mvn spring-boot:run` in the root directory or
import the Maven project and run it in your IDE
- Access the URL http://localhost:8080

### Note

- All `GET` request endpoints are accessible without authentication.


---
### Register

- To create posts and comments, you need to register:

**POST:** `/auth/register`   
**Content-Type: application/json**
```
{
	"login": "newUser",
	"password": "newPassword",
	"name": "Example Name",
	"email": "example@email.com"
}
```

By default, all users are created with the `USER` role. 
To become an `ADMIN`, you need to `change your role` attribute in the database. There is an endpoint capable of creating users with the ADMIN role, but only users with the ADMIN role can access it.

---
### Login 

- After registering, you need to authenticate:

**POST:** `/auth/login`   
**Content-Type: application/json**

```
{
	"login": "newUser",
	"password": "newPassword",
}
```

**Response:**

```
{
  "token": "your_access_token"
}
```

This access token will be your 'free pass' to create posts and comments

---


### Using the access token

After receiveing the successful access token, you need to include the header for your future requests. The access token must be passed as parte of the "Authorization" title. 

**Header example:**

```
Authorization: Bearer your_access_token
```

### Publication creation

**POST:** `/publications`

```
{
  "description": "Publication content",
  "imageLink": "link_for_image"
}
```

**Response:**

```
{
    "publicationId": 1,
    "userId": 1,
    "nameUser": "Your User Name",
    "description": "Publication content",
    "imageLink": "link_for_image",
    "date": "2024-02-10 19:13"
}
```

### Comment creation

**POST:** `/publications/{publicationId/comments`
