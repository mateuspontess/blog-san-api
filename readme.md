## Examples

### Note
- All `GET` request endpoints are accessible without authentication.

---

By default, all users are created with the USER role, these users can only create comments on posts. To become an ADMIN and be able to create posts, you can use the system's default ADMIN user:

#### Default user ADMIN
- **login**: root
- **password**: root

This way you can authenticate as ADMIN to have the freedom to create posts and even other ADMINs in the system.

---

### Register

To create posts and comments, you need to register:

**POST:** `/auth/register`   
**Content-Type: application/json**
```
{
	"login": "newUser",
	"password": "newPassword",
	"name": "Example Name",
	"email": "example@email.com"
}
```
---

### Login 

After registering, you need to authenticate:

**POST:** `/auth/login`   
**Content-Type: application/json**

```
{
	"login": "root",
	"password": "root",
}
```

**Response:**

```
{
  "token": "your_access_token"
}
```

This access token will be your 'free pass' to create posts and comments

---


### Using the access token

After receiveing the successful access token, you need to include the header for your future requests. The access token must be passed as parte of the "Authorization" title. 

**Header example:**

```
Authorization: Bearer your_access_token
```

---

### Publication creation

**POST:** `/publications`

```
{
  "description": "Publication content",
  "imageLink": "link_for_image"
}
```

**Response:**

```
{
    "publicationId": 1,
    "userId": 1,
    "nameUser": "Your User Name",
    "description": "Publication content",
    "imageLink": "link_for_image",
    "date": "2024-02-10 19:13"
}
```
---

### Comment creation

**POST:** `/publications/{publicationId/comments`

```
{
	"publicationId": 1,
	"text": "Comment example"
}
```

**Response:**
```
{
    "commentId": 1,
    "userId": 1,

    "date": "2024-02-10 19:10",
